<h1>ApiFusion VC import</h1>
<p>Import different data from Version Control starts from repository discovery enlisting the files and folders hierarchy.</p>

<p>Import stages:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Edit Import Parameters</li>
	<li>Read last import data</li>
	<li>Retrival AF hierarchy</li>
	<li>Retrival VC repository hierarchy</li>
	<li>Traverce over imported hierarchy and Run each selected import routine.<br />
		Repeated until whole hierarchy processed and each routine completed.</li>
	<li>Once completed or interrupted the the hierarchy could be <strong>saved</strong> 
		back to AF</li>
</ol>
<fieldset>
	<legend>Modules</legend>
	<ul>
		<li><var><a href="VcImport.html">VcImport.html</a></var>
			is a primary entry point for import process. 
			It is called from ApiFusion page with current location(a mediawiki title) in url parameters.
			<br />
			Embedded CSS and JavaScript are serving UI presentation and event handling.
		</li>
		<li><var><a href="VcImport.xml">VcImport.xml</a></var> is an initial content for imported data. 
			<br />It is loaded by xml AMD plugin <var>"ui/AMD/xml!./VcImport.xml"</var>. 
			This xml! plugin is used as AMD module and serving XSLT and XPath heplers.
			&quot;Import data&quot; section bellow details the content.</li>
		<li><var><a href="VcImport.xsl">VcImport.xsl</a></var> fills UI for import parameters and import progress/results. 
			<br />The import parameters are rendered only once. The tree view uses CSS for checkbox to arrow substitution.
			This xml! plugin is used as AMD module and serving XSLT and XPath heplers.
			<br />
			The xml+xsl output rendered into body on each xml change

	<legend>Import data</legend>
	The import data presented as XML which
	:
	<ul>
		<li>initially loaded from <a href="VcImport.xml">VcImport.xml</a></li>
		<li>eventually updated from ApiFusion for imports parameters defined in 1st import stage</li>
		<li>populated VC repository hierarchy</li>
		<li>on each hierarchy element the <var>routine</var>s added</li>
		<li><var>routine</var> filled with data, checksum created</li>
	</ul>
	Data sections:
	<ul>
		<li><var>routines/RepoTraverse/routine</var> defines the module for repository traverse. 
			
		</li>
		<li><var>routines/group//routine</var> defines the module for import. 
			It is presented in UI by <var>@name</var>. <br />
			During import for each <var>routine[@selected='1']</var>, 
			the routine object is instantiated by AMD JS loader by <var>@mid</var>. 
			The instance would be created on each file/folder on repository hierarchy. <br />
			AF would clone <strong>&lt;routine</strong>  into <var>folder|directory</var> level.<br /> 
			Routine would import content for review and comparison with previous import.

		</li>
		<li><var>routines/RepoTraverse/routine</var> present the import by repository type. 
			<br />Page will load JS by its <var>@mid</var>. 
			Than loaded module opens connection to repository with given credentials and traverce the repo hierarchy filling 
			<var>af:vcimport/repository</var>
		</li>
		<li>The folder/files structure from VC repository kept within <var>af:vcimport/repository</var> 
			as 
		</li>
		<li><var>folder</var> and <var>file</var> entries are subject for processing by selected <var>routine</var>s.
			<br />Each <var>routine</var> preserved as a child when run on entry. 
		</li>
		<li>Common for all <var>routine</var>s attributes:
			<ul>
				<li><var>@start</var>	timestamp of processing. Initially 0 until <var>routine</var> started.</li>
				<li><var>@end</var>		-||- ended</li>
			</ul>
			The imported data are preserved within <var>routine</var> element for comparison against following imports 
			and further integration on ApiFusion pages.
		</li>
		<li><var>folder/routine@checksum</var>. Upon import completion this attribute could replace the imported by 
			<var>routine</var> content assuming it is not dynamic(no timestamps, session info, etc). 
			Dynamic content should be comparable by <var>routine</var> implementation.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<legend>Import process UI</legend>
	The VC repository hierarchy is shown as a collapsible tree to observe the each level individually. 
	<br />The stats on each <var>routine</var> precented as column with completion % computed as ratio 
		of processed counter( with non-zero <var>@end</var> ) to total child couner.
	<br /><var>routine</var> could have specific stats like number of module methods/members or help entries.
	Those will make own sub-section within routine column and compute the completion 
	% against previous import results. If no previous import for
	<var>
	routine</var> found, those sections omitted.</fieldset>
<fieldset>
	<legend>RoutinesLoop</legend>
	The processing tick will traverse over import hierarchy and for each node:
	<ol>
		<li>find the routine from selection list which does not have a clone within node </li>
		<li>skip the routine if count(//routine[@end='0']) >= @activeRoutines limit reached</li>
		<li>clone the routine node, set @start</li>
		<li>create routine object by MID, passing hierarchy and routine nodes into constructor </li>
		<li>for routines with @timeout create the timeout with set @error="timeout" on routine node and call routine.destroy()</li>
		<li>call run() method directly if routine is async(has @timeout) in background  by setTimeout(0) wrapped by exception handler.<br />
			Upon completion the timeout to be cancelled by invoking destroy()</li>
	</ol>
	The need for guard of routine.run() by executing in separate thread TBD. It could be handy for:
	<ul>
		<li>insulation of code as it could belong to uncontrolled third party</li>
		<li>making the execution interruptable in case the processing takes too much time</li>
		<li>insulation of memory pool as the routine could have a memory leak</li>
	</ul>
	Once the one of following conditions met the jailed run() execution 
	must be implemented:
	<ul>
		<li>the file content is loaded into JS context. 
			The streaming processing is a true solution but it is difficult to implement. 
			It is simpler to work with content string loaded by XHR.</li>
		<li>the 3rd-party routine allowed to run on AF import page.</li>
	</ul>
